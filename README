A simple tool to re-write the MAC address of packets that go through this
daemon. Maintains a dictionary that contains a mapping of the source ip
address of a packet to a randomize mac address and rewrites the source
mac address of the packet for outgoing (egress?) packets. Does the reverse
for incoming (ingress?) packets.

EXAMPLE: 
  Egress (all source):
	<00:30:1b:b9:97:d7>/192.168.10.3 --> <00:00:5e:00:04:44>/192.168.10.3
	<00:30:1b:b9:97:d7>/192.168.10.4 --> <00:00:5e:00:01:44>/192.168.10.4
	<00:30:1b:b9:97:d7>/192.168.10.5 --> <00:00:5e:00:01:44>/192.168.10.4

  Ingress (all destination):
    <00:00:5e:00:04:44>/192.168.10.3 --> <00:30:1b:b9:97:d7>/192.168.10.3
    <00:00:5e:00:01:44>/192.168.10.4 --> <00:30:1b:b9:97:d7>/192.168.10.4
	<00:00:5e:00:01:44>/192.168.10.4 --> <00:30:1b:b9:97:d7>/192.168.10.5
